# NFLX-Bootcamp-Final-Project-Group-1

TITLE:  Road Safety and FSD Beta Testing

PURPOSE:
    The purpose of this project is to prepare Tesla on its roll out of its FSD beta testing in the UK, 
based on accident data collected in the UK during 2020.

MAIN QUESTION:   What factors lead to accidents and how could they be avoided?

GUIDING QUESTIONS:

   1. When do most accidents happen?  
   2. How does speed limit play a role in the number of casualties of an accident?
   3. How are road conditions associated with the number of casualties? 
   4. Where do the most severe accidents occur?


Overall we found: 

   1. The Rate of casualties in accidents does differ during the day
   2. Faster speeds in comparison to slower ones have higher rate of casualties
   3. Road conditions do impact the number of casualties of accidents
   4. Location does impact the severity of accidents, and they are more severe in rural than urban locations
